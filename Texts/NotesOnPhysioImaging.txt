Historical Therapy

Introduction

Historical therapy really takes into consideration the historical aspect of man’s development.  That is, it sees the real effect a man’s history has on his later development.  It also takes a look at how an individual constructs his own “history”, that is, how the individual creates a story over time which represents his life experience.  In historical therapy, paranoia is seen as a thought disorder which can only be solved through its own medium, through thinking.  We partly inherited a Reichian view of man as having bioelectrical or bioenergetic charges that need to be released and that take the shape of muscular and character armors, except that we call these charges physio-images.  In our view, physio-images are neither negative nor positive.  They are simply bioelectrical charges kept in the cells of the body from previous experiences.  We call all input into the brain neurotrauma.  That is, all peak events in bioelectricity in the brain are called neurotraumas.  A man’s personal history is stored as the charged up physio-images as a long line of neurotraumas over the course of his life.

Immediately after birth, the child begins contemplating his universe, groping around his biological center towards a greater and greater area or periphery around that center.  This is how the child learns the geo-grammar of his surroundings, that is, the geological grammar of the space that surrounds him, with its sedimentary layers.  The child will develop according to its genetic baggage which we call genosense and the particular history of its infancy.  Soon the child will learn to represent events to itself through self-narration and the beginning of the end has been engaged.  Man can deny where he comes from but he can’t escape the deterministic force of the history of his development.  So we will be looking at the different techniques of our historical therapy and how they are applied to paranoia and schizophrenia.

It is important, firstly, to grasp the true nature of the narrative.  The personality, as we see it, is a historical system.  On top of that, it is a subjective historical system.  The system orders itself, organizes itself around themes that are chosen by the individual.  At the age when a child begins socializing, a main narrative picture is chosen: i.e. I want to be seen as x, y or z.  Peak events are chosen and fitted into the main story.  The personality itself is this subjective historical system that projects itself in narrative form to the Other or to itself, giving meaning to itself.  This has a survival function: To strengthen the social group, to know what X is experiencing, to cut out the possibility of a threat, by means of seeking security.

The personality is a self-reflexive system of representation.  This is what makes it historical.  It is subjective because it self-presents, or presents itself to itself and to the Other.  At a certain age, a choice is made, the choice of autonomy, the choice that makes me an independent geological fragment or plate.  The very nature of the subjective experience is “relatable”.  We seek companionship to be able to tell our stories, our narratives.  But there is such a thing as narrative failure, when everyone is so caught up with their own stories that listening does not take place.  Then the self can become alienated or disillusioned.  A sort of bankruptcy of the personality or subjective historical system takes place.  Social stigma can also cause this disenfranchisement, this slow dehumanization.  This is what we will see in the case of paranoid schizophrenia.

Prison-states and their Transcendence

“Man’s first pitfall is his mind, which classifies things into kinds.
His second pitfall is his heart, which is affected from the start.”

Introduction
Those lines of poetry ring true to me.  Man is born a giver of meanings and purposes.  He learns to structure time, but every activity is, in essence, an escape from his empty existence: For there is no intrinsic value, meaning, or purpose to his life.  That is why man will kill himself in the name of creating a new value, meaning, or purpose, and will fight terrible wars over the same objective.  There is, however, a way out of this basic prison-state.

Man is born a plastic, impressionable, medium.  He is an organism made up of cells, and the environment, more hostile than beneficial, cuts into him, creating reactions which are peaks of biolectricity in his brain, and which we are calling neurotrauma.

Man is born at a great disadvantage.  He cannot see to his own well-being, he is dependent on others from the start.  The truth is that we are always interdepedent: Neither completely dependent nor completely independent.  We need others, but they need us too.  Take the example of the child and think of what the child gives back to his caretakers.  That pure love of childhood, that trust, those smiles, those first words.  No one can deny the magic of the child.  And we, as adults, are to a certain degree addicted to this innocence, genetically.

Man communicates innately with his environment.  He is built knowing inside that there are certain key stimuli in the environment that he is destined to come face to face with.  Our view is that grief is one of these key stimuli.

There is no guidebook that we are born with that teaches us how to grieve, but there is an innate sense, when grief takes place, that it is a necessary part of life.  If one avoids this sense, one is living an illusion.  And many people do live in an illusory world, denying that the lost person is really gone, being angry at God and bargaining with Him, etc.

Man is born essentially lost to himself, his life empty of meaning and purpose, but his purpose and the meaning to his life is this: To give meaning and purpose to his life, to make sense of his life in every way imaginable.  

Neurotrauma, those peak events in biolectricity in the brain, make up our daily experience of the world and ourselves.  From the birth ecstasy to death of mind and body, life is a chain of these peak events which are recorded in the cellular life of man’s body.  That is, on a molecular level, life leaves its scars: And the experience of peak events in biolectricity is like a scarification process on the impressionable medium that is the body and mind.

Man is an ecstatic creature.  He was built to feel things intensely.  In many ways, this is one of the fundamental prison-states that he is in, the prison-state of feeling.  But it is also the way out a lot of the time.

There are objects that we call signs out in the environment which are causal elements in our feeling an excitation organically.  They can be organ-signs, like the breast to the child, which elicits the suckling instinct.  It is in this way that certain environmental signs elicit instinct-schemes.  But man, being an ecstatic creature, also has ecstatic objects or signs, that, in turn, elicit ecstatic states and ecstatic schemes.  We see this in the mystic or poet.

In fact, all objective signs in the environment are neurotraumatic objective signs.  Yet there are “true” or “believable” objective signs, that lead to belief, and “doubtful” or “obscure” ones that lead to doubt.  Those that are “doubtful” lead to creative acts of intelligence, while the “true” ones often lead to the enactment of instinct-schemes.

Life is a learning experience, but also the expression of the instinctual, mechanical, or automatic aspect of man as animal.  The primary excitation in man’s brain, pulled from objective reality as a response to it, makes up what we call the physio-image or physiological mass.  The physiological mass is “charged up” into the real substance of the physio-image.
One thing about the particulate, physiological mass is that it must be absorbed.  There is no other alternative.  And that is what man does all the livelong day, absorb the physiological mass of the physio-images which reality makes him create.

It is possible to use physio-images in a therapeutic vein.  One needs only to recall them and to find a way to release the charge that they keep.  This brings us to the concept of the “logical pathology” or “logopathy”, that is, a self-narrative that is two lines entwined, the line of logical thoughts and images, and the line of emotional content.  In fact, we think in physio-images, both imagistic content and physiological content mixed together in one self-narrative.  For man recounts endlessly to himself that which he experiences in the world.  One will notice this process of creating a narrative that one simply “fits into”.  This is how we build identities, as city-dwellers or citizens of great nations, or just plain victims of the world.

Man determines his own future by the continuous labor of his self-narration.  In fact, man’s destiny is autodetermination, as he creates his future, in substance, in reality, a real concrete future.  In the process of creating it, he goes through so many transformations.  At the beginning, he doesn’t quite know where he wants to go, or the general direction that his life already has.  He begins to sort of grope around and comes to certain conclusions based on the repetition of certain laws it seems that regulate the experience of the world.  Maybe if he is lucky at some point he even discovers a truth or two and so his life begins taking on a particular shape, and he knows at some point that he is no longer living the unhappy life that he had lived for several decades or so.  But if asked when he decided to change the general outcome of his life, man doesn’t know where it started or if it has ended quite yet.

All of this from the habit of creating a story into which one fits.  One can see, however, how man’s habit of storytelling becomes his own prison: The many prison-states created by the mind tend often to keep us in the submissive state of slave-bondage, be it slavery to an ideal or to one’s own expectations.

Man is subject to many determinisms.  His only way out is to maximize his absorbance of physiological masses.  It’s either that or death.  Sickness comes from not absorbing or metabolizing neurotraumatic, bioelectrical charges that flood in ceaselessly from the sense-organs.  This is how the brain puts neurotraumatisms into archives, by absorbing charges and making physio-images of reality, like impressions in the cells of the brain mass.

Man, however, can never escape the prison-state of biology.  He can escape the endlessly turning wheels of his active mind and the scale of his emotions in his heart, but he can never escape the fact that he is a biological subject.

An improvisatory demonstration like painting, can be both mythical and philosophical, logical = hence, a novelistic phenomenology (historical self-presentation through physio-imaging of projection laws).

a)Tonal Cinema
b)Novelistic phenomenology
c)Historiotherapy
d)Physio-imaging (as self-presentation of history or relational linguistics)

(And also a lexicon can work like this to give a physio-imaging lexicon iconology, i.e. cinematic technical-habitual hence formal-critical self-presentation as historical, i.e. memorial / documentary & operant evidence, in law evidence which forwards defence, impedes, or is useless, or a)changes internal integrity of one hearing, or does not, to the next – Qualities of Projection – but also physio-image, physio-imaging vs. projection.)

Ecstasy of inhabiting the habit system, of having an identity skip through technologization of the ego : a)through physio-imaging, b)novelistic phenomenology, c)defragmentation, d)focus, e)decrypting / reading material memory, etc., f)and through influence, i.e. democracy, love, or sympathetic participation.

Habitant as persona for characters; hence, in T/I/C / History-Project in my novel – Habitant interprets characters’ lives (Evelyn, Dr. K., as political prisoners) and letters are “Boy” or messengers / lines of contact, arabesques between blocks / types / plates of segmental tonal effects which are self-presented in so many ways specifically for historiotherapeusis for “The History Project” to be both reading and writing, coequal, of equidistant sympathetic participation or resonance, i.e. love, technique, craft, contact as distant closeness using identity and its metaphysic to prove that physio-imaging is T/I/C and that a lexicon iconology in the Metaphysic of Art Movements not only exists but in its “relational-linguistic novelistic-phenomenology” form can provide a new understanding of images, sounds, and their possible interpenetrative and variable utility for interdisciplinary projects which get lost in needless and time-consuming (exhaustive or detrimental) foothpaths and therefore a New Vision of Theory is both a cyclopedia / textbook / manual and helps build a national identity as History-painting in hopes of resolution of Canadian homeland policies concerned with dispersion or averaging-out of population versus present city-state agglomerates which reek of Island Fever and painful Hysteria.  Moral: learn to read without eyes and use relational method of development of demographic solidarity, i.e. granularity, i.e. heterogeneity giving tools for networks of free-floating citizens who can create sitespecific or nonsitespecific collectivities using whatever economies aid solidarity, i.e. are useful, to the sovereign & popular locality.

Proof of a Physiological Basis for the
Concurrency Presented by History:

1.Experience of History.  Living presently in March, 2003, 
The excitations and relaxations of things felt.  The manner ways in which history has been [re-]presented.  Belief in physiological basis for so-called ‘historical consciousness’ hereby reduced merely to historical presentations, esp. to self.  These occur within the reach of metabolic systems, an endogenous capacity to preview structuration of historic consolidation, compression, condensation, concentration, or cohesion.  Mainly from preview of intracellular collagen.  Mitosis therefore presents dispersive analogies in mentalistic reappraisal of physio-image, i.e. electromagnetic, electrostatic, biochemical, viz. organic proof of seen historicity.

Bio-image, geo-image: tectonics of sedimentary layers, geological model of thought.  Eye Affects: muscular (fibrous), electrochemical (circuitous).  Impulse as shoot; homo habitus as lightning or graven image or grooves on a phonographic record.  As tributaries towards for the gulf.

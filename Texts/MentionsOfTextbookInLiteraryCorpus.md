MENTIONS OF TEXTBOOK IN LITERARY CORPUS:

###

———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———
Part Two:
How this all comes together, I don’t know.  I just know that it does, it has to.  If it doesn’t connect, then I’m not a surrealist.  Veristically, I am.  That’s what I’m trying to treat here, that modern concept of surrealism, how it shines today, now, this moment, the next, the coming, the arriving, saddling the moment, creating within it, in its current, its course.  
Da-sein:
Heidegger comes between Surrealism and Cubism in his ‘Being and Time’.  He shows the exact mark which distinguishes the separate boundaries.  The main feature of surrealism is Projection.  The act of invention through use of the Imagination, the Intellect, all right and proper.  Making dream material manifest in the sphere of the physical.  In the question of being we have the immaculate shadow unveiled in its blank staring-at-walls sadness.  In inimical nakedness, we have the great naked icon beingness.  This part reads as a dream transcript.  We want to elevate the present processes to the level of adaptation through questioning.  We need to access the spirit of surrealism and recreate it in a textbook of surrealist prose, a work that can be opened anywhere and Surrealism is spoken of.  Phenomenologically, surrealism is an event of viewing pictorial material with action in the eyes and brain relating to the material being watched.  
I must quote from one of my novellas.  It’s the only way I have right now to express what the nature of surrealism is on the plane of phenomena.

What is Tonal Cinema?  What is ‘proximate’?  Latin proximatus, past participle of proximare, to approach, from proximus, nearest, next… it means, according to Merriam-Wesbter, “immediately preceding or following (as in a chain of events, causes, or effects)”.  So what immediately precedes this?  The orientation of this project is to tell what surrealism is and can be in the moment.  Ah, it sounds awful, I know, it sounds like some sort of rhetorical twist or trick.  I’m merely trying to pin down what is happening in the moment that I say, “This is art.”  In that moment, I have taken a thing, an object, and made it an object of art.  This has expanded the regions where the object works.  I have identified a new realm whereby the object can exist, the realm of art.  In Tonal Cinema, the object IS the art.  Each individual that works as hard as I have to find the meaning of anything IS an engineer of cinema, the tonal cinema that exists in the shadows, the one that scares us, the one that lingers as smoke deep into the wooded areas of experience.  You tackle it and what do you get?  You get a whole series of individual concepts.  They work together and you formulate a vehicle of art whereby different styles can come into communication with other particular styles.  All is in connection.  All is supplying us with an index.
How did we come from surrealism to the index?  The index is simply what the autobiographical textbook offers to the reader of this silent cinema.  We have the main structure and it lines up as so:

	1)Surrealism is a form of art
	2)It is when the lines between art and life become vague, art becomes life, life becomes art in a sort of eclectic communion.  Tonal Cinema is the name that I have given to the science of poetry of the moment.  When I lay down after a hard day’s work and I say, “Ah, all this work, all this evidence of the structures of what is for real…” I have created a landslide.  The virtual textbook is opened.

	I have taken exact liberties of the reader to express how surrealism exists as an aesthetic.  It’s the reflections module.  It is how text is expressed in the phrases of a hard-working mind.  After a long day, the phrases of poetry that come out of a surrealist poet, these are all the evidence necessary to exult in knowing that we have been detained to read something that is worth our while, something that textually might not be Kant or Heidegger, but it might be some sort of something that makes an abstract sense, so keep going…
	We have a definite program of movement.  This means that we are entertaining the wheelworks of an intimate cognition of beingness.  Heidegger was right, go  back to the question of being.  Being in a landslide, how does one complete the phrases that one has started?
	Surrealism is the movement of art in the shadows of the mind, in its operations, in its movement from plane to plane, surface to surface.  What has made the surface important?  Modern art is concerned with the infinitude of this: the surface.  What can surrealism tell us about this subject?
	Turn to the first page of a textbook of the philosophy of surrealism.  This might as well be the first page, it doesn’t matter, it’s not a book you read entirely, it’s only something you grasp in the moment, a slice that passes by your eyes and makes you think for an instant.
	When we look at the surface, we see moving objects.  Objects literally move across the page.  How is this done?  This is done by the use of ambiguity as a figure.  The rhetorical figure of ambiguity, otherwise known as enigma.  Related figures are noema, schematismus, allegory, and paradox.  This is the hardware of the philosophy of surrealism in the human mind.  Surface and conversion.  How does the surface meet a conversion?  It does this by being made into a work of art.  Before being a work of art, the surface is a material for art.  It is converted from mere material to an aesthetic object.  How does this happen?  It’s not a matter of how it happens, more importantly, it is a matter of why and where it happens.  It happens on the page, he tells me.  My friend tells me that when he looks at a piece of work by Dali, it’s as though things are moving on the page.  I look one second at two nuns and then I’m looking at a bust of Voltaire.  It’s what Freud called sublimation, isn’t it?  I’m horribly confused, move onto the next part.  I’m going from experience, I’m working with a strange compilation of historical fact and imaginative/creative material.
———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———	———
	Part three:
	Projection of what materials?  We have gone from the realm of historical materialism to the realm of, “What the hell am I to do with this object if I am a painter and need to learn about surrealism?”  Spatter paint onto a canvas.  Take a new leaf, a clear, unsullied sheet of paper and spray colored water onto it.  The shape of the spots on the paper will tell you what you need to know.  Whether they form a concept or an idea, I don’t know.  You have to take it to that level if you want to.  All I am saying is that by merely dropping a few specks of paint onto a canvas, you can see how the air reacted in that particular moment to the drying of paint.  Was there lots of air, was there little?  I can’t express it, when you will come to this platform, when you will take out a piece of paper and drop a drop of ink on it, you will tell me where we are going, you will tell me what we are doing with art and surrealism.
	Projection in surrealism is the projection of the ink blot right back at you.  You stare into the ink blot, you’re doing the test, and you’re seeing nothing.  All you see is spilled ink.  What shape does it make in your mind?  What realms of consciousness does it touch?  Surrealism, we can say, came into play in the 1920s.  In the middle of the 1920s, surrealism took the car for a spin but never came back.  Who do you believe?  Who is telling the truth about surrealism, the textbook writers?  Only if the textbook is lexical and inter-referential.  That way you can open it anywhere and get a transcript of where art is at the moment, where surrealism is as it chews on old dust and ashes.  Surrealism won’t let us in, we had to settle with its younger brother, THE IMAGE.  What does the image mean?
	The image.  The object.  The page.  I agree, this is a slow process.  We are taking it slowly through each generation of the object of the thesis.  First we have art, then we have surrealism somehow, and now we are questioning how the image reacts with me the viewer.  When I look at a painting by one of the many surrealist, I am left with questions.  This is a common fact in art history.  How can you not be tantalized by these geniuses of manipulation of data?  Anyone in their right mind wants to know what Marx was cooking up with a spoon when he smoked crack for the first time.  That was a joke.

Part four:
	Surrealism sits in the middle of the room where the unconscious vortex explodes into action.  The patient sits in the office with his doctor, his psychiatrist, and tells all that he has to tell.  He says it straight through, even looks at picture and tells the doctor what he sees in them.  We are catching a view of the patient as he leaves the office, walking towards the bus.  Another wanderer lost in the transit of life.  He takes the bus and goes off to his wasted watchword land of concepts and deterrents to madness.  All is a puzzle that this idle peon walks through.  He is Alice, he is Prometheus bound to the rock, he IS the rock, the foundation of all that is real.  The desert is hot when the sun comes down.  Prometheus will make it across if it takes an entire lifetime.  We have dream figures punched into the light of day.  We have martial law over everything perceptible, we are in control of the wayward airplane.
	Wayward space as the lines of tears trickle down my face.  I am the lost hero of the story, I am he that makes it to the brand new day.  I will hold fire to my breast and a camera to suffer not the children.  I will digress and make a scene about nothing, then swirl off into empty space with a decathlon of hopes relit and matched up with fate the disassembled member.  Create for myself a new life and a new ponderable quality to seaward motion.  To the heart of the waters, let’s all avalanche there!  We are surgeons of the moment, chroniclers of the true fate of history.
	The vortex is at the heart of the textual landscape.  In the valley, snug, well-fitted into the links of our mission the republic of nonsense.  The textual labyrinth has been opened.  We are set free down the landslide of the moment.  By sprinkling ink on the page, we have sullied it with the genetic material intact, or rather the chemical geography, topology of the moment, the splashing of the waves of perceptual stimuli.  Think of it, matter just sits there to be observed.  If that was my final thesis, I’m astray in muddy straits.
	Surrealism is half this expressionism, the splashing.  The other half in the aesthetic realm is the reflections, the intradimensional pathways, the vortices and whirlpools in the DNA pool.  The vortex is spiritual, is the remnant of a primitive brain.  Surrealism is a science.  You wear the lab-coat and you’re a surgeon.  With surgical precision you work out the rhetorical figures of the moment in history.  In through the web, we find significant points.  Our premises arched under our arms, we battle on the field of action, in the beginning of the moment, though it is always continuous, rarely stops, cycles onward and we meet the exact outline of the science of surrealism.  It is performed here in the textbook setting.

The Projector is the short story theorist.  We see through the eye of the projector, we see the projected.  An important thing about it is that it is significant.  The significance is rooted in the unconscious.  This is where the sphere of surrealism operates, out in the realm of the unconscious, but a literal transcript of the events of the mind conscious and unconscious together forming a complex organism, all in the network of a symbolic system like logic or grammar.  This allows us to cut into the story at any point, random or generated abstractly.  The first concepts of surrealism are concerned with the general wheel that the cycles of life make, the psychedelic wheel of great wonder and satisfaction, the projected cinema of abstract planes colliding, with the shapes of the system as the protagonists of the story.  We write a textbook about this science and present/project it in the form of an essay on surrealism.  It will be a textbook and will give a brief history of surrealism in the mind of the one-wishing-to-acquire-new-art-knowledge.

There’s a contagiousness involved in the rhetoric.  Like a disconnected impression of the words themselves meaning what is most important.  It reads laterally like a textbook, like a textbook as an example of an art examination, an examination of art.  Syntax sometimes is all you have to do to understand a problem.  The problematic is easily understood by looking at the straight facts.  The camera enters the stream of concepts at the inception of a great river of chaos.  The camera creates a unique experience of voyeurism and visionary induction.  Remember that some surrealists followed the abstract tradition whereas others followed the symbolist tradition.

AN INTERLUDE:
On The Surrealism Textbook:

We have to take a look at Surrealism at this point. 
It was born and has passed.  We are now in the
after-age of Surrealism, so it needs to be perceived
in today’s light, with the knowledge that we have at
this stage about art, technology, and science.

A  The textbook style:
I have used the regular textbook style because I find
it uses the features of text well enough that it can
be of use in writing about Surrealism.  Surrealism is
a school with a long history (200+ years).  It has its
roots in Romanticism, in Dada, in literary futurism. 
In Quebec, Surrealism has its own special place in the
political and artistic fields of activity.  I hope
that this textbook style fulfils what the reader needs
to understand the concepts we will organize and teach.
 

B What is happening in Quebec?
I chose Quebec as the center of my essay because I
live in Quebec, it’s as simple as that. I didn’t want
to generalize too much with other countries such as
Canada or France because I don’t know what it’s like
to live in those countries and the study would have
been too hard and too long for my intents and
purposes.  

Problems to solve: PROBLEM 1
What do Surrealism and Cinema have in common?

Film is an interface.  Its tape is the long tale of
Romanticism that mutated into Surrealism.  Classicism
had once turned into Cubism at another time
altogether, in another age.  It is true that a world
war changes the era, creates a pre- and post-war
universe.  War rattles all the scales.  Measuring
changes with war.  Techniques and procedures change,
so do the people.  This is a sociolinguistic art
history piece in the form of a creative textbook. 
Film and Surrealism have a dialectic.  Surrealism is a
state of mind, so is the experience of the cinema.

E Update on Textbook Style:
Again, I’m using the textbook style because it fits
the pattern laid out by the human mind.  The pattern
of the concepts of surrealism have to be created in
the mind of the reader, and so we follow the form of
these thoughts, these ideas, these concepts, and the
reader benefits in a threefold way: 1 the reader
absorbs the forms of the thoughts of surrealism; 2 the
reader has the thought-material in the form of a
particular text to study and re-study; 3 the forms are
basic forms and easy to understand and eventually
imitate.  The textbook style is a modern style and is
most efficacious.  It follows the modern reader’s mind
in its absurd business of thought-propagation.

The textbook style is also a cut-up style.  Everything
is meant to be cut up into thin slices, into small
compartments.  Easier to understand that way.  And its
simpler to follow the shapes of surrealist
consciousness that way too.  


	If I wrote the full history of the schools of thought involved in these separate sciences, I would have a philosophy textbook.  If I were writing a textbook, I would want it to deal more with cinema than physics or arithmetic. I’m for all that is cinematic at heart.

XXIX The Newspaper:
A Book: Lost Frames [Daguerreotypes]
I
Metaphysics: 1 a division of philosophy that is
concerned with the fundamental nature of reality and
being and that includes ontology, cosmology, and often
epistemology; 2 abstract philosophical studies: a
study of what is outside objective experience

Ontology: 1 a branch of metaphysics concerned with the
nature and relations of being; 2 a particular theory
about the nature of being or the kinds of existents

This is not the simple explication or elucidating of a
simple theme.  This is a serious ontological study
concerning the story of being that is expressed by
living beings in their every waking, breathing moment.
 What we have is an instance of a book, a brief
outline of a book of epistemological dissertations, an
invisible book but a book with an enduring impact and
the human beings involved, namely the readers and the
writers who have devoted millions of hours together
near and apart, few, many here and there scattered
across the earth with but one cause in mind: the
elevation of the book, the plane of books, the book
field, all the theories implicated in its development.
 There also exists the metaphysical transcript: a
short chronicle of a metaphysical science.

If we had a book that showed the multifarious
processes of the human mind, it would have to be a
textbook written in point-form since the processes are
so numerous; the textbook would be a collection of
textbooks, a treasure, a
thesaurus/glossary/bibliography, or the mystic’s
lexical iconology.

We begin in a bookstore in NDG—Notre-Dame-de-Grace—on
a Sunday afternoon in the summer.  The middle-aged
lady, owner of said shop, discusses at great lengths
with coming and going potential buyers, friends,
acquaintances, all the holy viscera of human
communication, socializing, all the disseminated
legion of souls commuting through the gridwork of
geographical existence, of the topology of each
moment, where each chess piece has most recently
moved.  Reality is as a game of chess, or a
treasure-chest, depending on the viewer.

Beatrice is a book collector and loves books more than
life.  She contends that ‘the textual object has a
greater appeal than merely speaking or saying because
the illusion is one of incredible might’.  She sits at
the cash register amid stacks of books.  She keeps her
favorites near-at-hand.

How the theme of this display shall come to pass, that
very disfigurement of being cannot be seen from here. 
To know the outcome of this play, we would need a
PROJECTION.  Anticipation and expectancy are two of
the contenders of Projection.  It is instilled with a
slight vigil over objects of the mind, concepts,
neutralities, confection of ideas, brutalities,
comatose dreamlings… so that Projection is how we view
the history of our main treasure THE BOOK; through the
eye of the projector, the book, our textual object
[textual is textural] is seen as the teleological
heirloom that it is in full flight of an exodus from
the super-real contingency of an exhibition of prose
to reading viewers.  It is played out in an abstract
circus on the page.  Letters are spooled through old
projectors and projected on the screen of Reality, the
two-dimensional plane, the physics schemas, the
textbook (remember?)… It reads out like a lexicon, a
lexicon iconology, that is ICONOLOGY: the study of
icons or artistic symbolism, and LEXICON: 1 a book
containing an alphabetical arrangement of the words in
a language and their definition: DICTIONARY; 2 the
vocabulary of a language, an individual speaker or
group of speakers, or a subject.  This is the
textbook: a book used in the study of a subject: as a)
: one containing a presentation of the principles of a
subject: b) a literary work relevant to the study of a
subject.

ICONICITY: correspondence between form and meaning
THE OPENING OF HER NEW SHOP : AN ANALYSIS OF THE
TEXTBOOK
THREE PAGES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE…

        Beatrice is projecting to the future.  She is held
still within the moment of anticipation : in a tired
image of time present, of time present anticipating
time future, the times of the reader and writer, the
timelessness in which the book lives.  The theoretical
textbook is the perfect embodiment of the idea of a
correspondence between form and meaning.  As you read
on, the form of the book is equal to the formulation
of its thoughts in the mind of the reader.  It is
evolutionary.  All goes through a process of
progression and permutation.  The chamber of
permutation is the mind.  A general theory of
psychology and textual analysis, a correspondence
between cognitive science and literary criticism, like
Freud linking the history of the mind with the history
of civilisation.  A projection in an old green light…

Reality is as a game of chess, or a treasure-chest,
depending on the viewer.  In this case, the projection
is of Beatrice in her bookshop, Beatrice the lover of
books, Beatrice in the development of this story. 
Text is aware of itself in these times post-modern on
the origin.  The bloody aggressiveness… 1989 and the
cynical half-sex of the moment of the sleeping
dormitory… The textbook is only alluded to in this
short piece.  A full analysis of The Metaphysical
Textbook of Human Learning would take several hundred
pages.  Apparently, it teaches everything from the
history of the library of Alexandria to the game of
chess.  It’s an entire scholastic tradition with a
mythico-mystico-poetical heritage.  

Johannes Clauberg (1647) remarks: ‘Since the science
which is about God calls itself Theosophy or Theology,
it would seem fitting to call Ontosophy or Ontology
that science which does not deal with this and that
being, as distinct from the others owing to its
special name or properties, but with being in
general.’

The book is a metaphysical one.  Beatrice is the heart
of the reader.  This is a short story, a brief account
of what the textbook can signify, what paper pages are
made of, what tradition says and what schools of
thought were born over the book as a sacred
individualist’s fortune hidden in a library…

HER HEILOOM/GIFT
Beatrice has realized that the concepts of art history
have one flaw: they can be copied perfectly. 
Everything is everything in art history and everything
is convertible.  “There is no set meaning for any of
this material.  I should have gotten a doctorate in
the English language, then I could publish it as a
dictionary.  Damn it, the Lexicon of Comparative
Terminology.  I would go through every scientific
field, I would make a comparative analysis, and the
synthesis would be my genealogy, the surrealist
escapade, the purely theoretical universe of
pipe-dreams and concrete theory, pure theory,
economics as well as cosmology and biology.  All
fields have a textbook.  I want to write the textbook
of all textbooks.  It would have to be cut up into
small sections.  Short chapters and always in threes,
always in threes, because that’s how a synthesis
works.  The dictionary is different but still as
useful.  The lexical iconography is all I have, it’s
the rulebook inside my heart, I breathe it in and out
a thousand times each day… it’s what I want to give to
the world, a new theory of existent and inexistent
objects, concepts, things, beings, entities, systems. 
I want to offer a new perspective, that of the
booksmith, the writer of textbooks, the most
frequently quoted and the most unknown of writers. 
She teaches children mathematics and college students
a little poetry to appease them.  They are agents of
social control.  Their textbooks can be very
enlightening when one has studied the subject
carefully before writing about it, when one gives an
exact duplicate of the object of the theory one is
expounding.”

Beatrice comes from a long line of educated mothers. 
Jewish mysticism was practiced more than once in her
lineage.  Mysticism seems to have a certain textuality
to it.  Many of her great-grandmothers were prolific
letter-writers, bringing a powerful epistolary
heirloom passed on from mother to daughter down a
diagonal or curved line.  Mothers had mothers who were
into photography, another great proponent of Text. 
The image is a text, the panorama is many images
linked together, cyclorama, prestigious art, ‘a large
pictorial representation encircling the spectator and
often having real objects as foreground’, is Text. 
Beatrice’s mother taught her the ancient art of
falsification.  Many a mother had transcribed
liturgical text, epistles back in Rome… the hidden
mothers of history, they have been called.  A long
line of mothers leading back to Jesus.  To copy, to
counterfeit; all is a counterfeit, a reproduction. 
And it is performed in an exhibition in tonal cinema:
i.e. textual representation, vocal calls, words,
phrases, tones in a musical scale, modes of the scale,
different perspectives taken on the line, the musical
line, the line of the parents, the line between dream
and reality in the surrealistic charade.  We come back
to the circus with a majordomo in a top-hat.  The
elephants are in a procession.  All is bathed in the
light of ritual, is prismatic, showing all the colors.
 The music is acerbic and played in quick flashes of
explosive sound.  Beatrice and Berenice and all the
other mothers and daughters have a simultaneous
realization or epiphany: the circus has run through
town, make now for the cemetery in a complex mediation
of events.  The first letter is written.  It
encompasses the study of existent and non-existent
things, anything involved in being or non-being, gods,
concepts, invisibilities, nothingness, the great
cyclical pageant of the unconscious, a cosmological
wheel of constellations, zodiacal, metaphorical, the
allegory of time, of the movement of stellar beings. 
This is the true city, circus, cemetery, cinema.  This
allegory is coming truer and truer to the title of
this essay: “A Book: Lost Frames [Daguerreotypes]”. 
We see an old village from the days of Impressionism. 
Edgar Degas is taking pictures.  He is with a woman
related to the chieftain mother of this article, Time,
an accessory to the crime of ideas, the conceptual
crime of falsifying a textbook and a tradition of
textbook writers, of inventing a story, of writing
down the processes of one’s own mind over time in the
form of an impromptu essay on lost frames, forgotten
images, memories from childhood, from school, from
work, ideas and plagues of consciousness reverberating
across the concrete blocks in the storage rooms in the
library of Alexandria.  An aged mother takes care of
the books in the vaults, makes sure the temperature is
right.  Beatrice is typing away at the typewriter. 
“I’m almost finished, the theme will have gone through
several variations.  It is quite musical; I am proud
of it.”  And so she skits off to the living-room to
look at old photographs from her great-grandmother in
Paris.  “Margaret was a fantastic portraitist.  She
knew how to capture the myth in man.”  Closer and
closer to a spiritual crisis.  Textbook is the mark,
the spirit is contagious, comes about in a circular
fashion, a dance, a wish, a gaze, an ancient
storehouse of comedic/epic phantasma art: the
phantasmagoria, kaleidoscopic in nature, a ritual of
cave-painters art, a dance in age-old vomit in plagues
and pestilence, real art sensational expressionist
cavalcades of motion seaward hunger phenomenal in the
heart of a land digesting its people, its ideas, its
books, O Book that is Never Told, that is Never as
great as the Word, mouth to ear, pen to paper, why are
you so old, so coveted, book, lost image in the
memorial hospital, creator of a long list of prophetic
titles, the bibliography of the moment and what
created it in movements of thought in history… Now it
is written. 

8th Emanation: Victory
Victor walks in at home back from his physics class.  The universe is shifting before his eyes.  “Old mathematics textbook, that’s where it’s all at.  I’m reading the damn thing and there’s a mystical subtext that I’m picking up on.  It’s because physics has a tradition also.  Anything with a tradition of a couple thousand years oral tradition or textual tradition, copying out entire manuscripts; painting is a tradition, all art is a tradition, a craft, un métier.  


9th Emanation: Majesty
The tradition of story-telling, of teaching.  They used to teach you a series of oral tales to remember.  You had a collection or treasury in your mind of this oral tale, this teaching, this eternal dialogue programmed into you by your forefathers.  What you have is this cycle of tales, or myths, dreams, retellings of historical events mimed or spoken or sung in songs, the genesis of the universe, the fall of man, the first emanations of the universe, mirrors, codes, figures, photographic plates, scarves, it all ends in the same measure of the absolutes: non serviam, I will not serve.  That is the manifesto with a thousand signatures from all the great artists of the world.  To make it in art you need passion, creativity, and wisdom.  Part emotion, part rational thinking.  You have memorized the old logic textbook, mathematics, theology, anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, ad infinitum.  You memorized all that was existent, epistemology, ontology, physics, metaphysics, thraumaturgy.  The study of miracles is a fine art.  Master falsifiers were involved in miracle-noting.  Identify the cause of a bleeding crucifix.  They had me in their knuckles in Rome.  Falsification, it was all falsification after Marco Polo.  From Marco Polo on, nothing is datable.  It’s all an anhistorical mess.  Majesty is in the memories you keep of the ancient world, the paradise, in the eye of the beholder, the patterns, the burning cross, Lucifer in the ashes, Babel on the cobblestone street… Majesty in the eyes...

I realize that mimesis is our only form of learning.  Learning is a game.  Eastern mystics often tell jokes when they are teaching.  I have just understood what a book is by writing Treasures.  You unlock the lock, open the casket, and dig into objects from outside of history.  'Thesaurus' also means a collection, compendium, aggregation, accumulation, assemblage. Pharmakon in Derrida is something else, is the form of the universal book, I think.

I want to incorporate recipes.  They show a construction, a plan.. shots of ingredients labels, the tower of Label.  We didn't jam today, we're jamming tomorrow.  I slept but not really enough.  This is my second day without weed, I think.  I want to play with the word logos.  It's reason, speech, word, father somehow.. Maybe the Bible is actually made up of allegorical essays on grammatology, semiotics, linguistics, etc.  If you look at it conceptually by translating the poetic value of the words in the stories to concepts of rhetoric and grammar that they allegorically lead to, you have experienced learning.  I see the Bible [Plato and Aristotle's books too] as a universal forum of knowledge-giving.  The fall of adam and eve is really saying, "Man or woman, do not fall for it, these are just lessons, my child, what we are giving you here is knowledge, but do not eat it up."  The Bible itself is the tree of knowledge.  Eden is that space that we live in when we are reading and writing, when language is being summoned, controlled, and we're always falling in and out of it.  Exodus to me represents dissemination.  I could work on a short essay about post-modernism and the bible.  Write a fake story about the Bible being a physics textbook.  That's tonal cinema to me, the mid-space of mutual learning/teaching.  Passing on the flame to the next generation of readers.  Look at Prometheus, he gave us fire and was chained to a rock all his life.  Ideas are contagious, they spread around quickly.  You could say that the Book is Prometheus giving us fire and its punishment is that it can no longer - because of over-translation - reach its readers.  That's the fall from Eden.  The Crucifixion of the Book is happening as we speak.  Jesus was the Word made flesh, the Book is ideas made flesh [paper].  I think its writers were anticipating the end of the mystico-poetical tradition.  The final judgment, trial, is happening to us now.  That's what I love about the Bible, the material inside it can be applied to anything.  Thanks for sending me that quote, it helped me a lot.

   The History Project:
   I thought I would try to describe one of my History paintings just
   to show a bit of the theory behind it. I was contemplating one of my History paintings last night
   and this particular one I would call Historiography, not History. History makes me think of the
   way in which material existence passes onto new moments, is attached teleologically series to
   series, but Historiography is another thing altogether. It is the science/art of historical writing, and
   this is what I painted. The painting has several squares/rectanguloids that are attached to each
   other via labyrinthine 'railways'. Each line is meant to describe one particular historical 'line', line
   as in fishing line, streak of evidence, enunciation, proposition, phrase. The painting looks like a
   mother board from a computer. The analogies are endless. I was trying to see my painting in
   terms of graphemes, each line, and the lines follow zigzag courses, corresponding in my mind to
   historical accounts, but prototypically. The squares, the figures, represent planes, surfaces, fields,
   and the squares have drips and drops of paint that I sprayed on with a brush, which represent
   clusters as in aggregates or collectivities of historical data, facts, values... I played with color,
   using orange for a huge highway that cuts through the middle of the painting, orange as a bright
   'centric' color.. the background is green, the squares are purple and pink and blue. The labyrinth
   of zigzagging lines is overlaid with straight lines that I put on with a permanent marker. The
   straight lines form a sort of grid, and weave through the zigzag lines, forming a network, or 'text'.
   Some of my History paintings have curved lines made with a protractor, hinting to the
   geometricness of concepts [in my mind concepts can be graphed]. The whole History Project
   now has at least 30 physical manifestations which altogether form a nice portrayal of the methods
   and theories of History. I can't wait to share it with you guys. It's really the beginning of
   something very special to me, something that will be the center of a bigger project, one in which I
   will chart art history and the philosophy of art history in graphs and diagrams, to express the
   shapes of the concepts of art history as they appear in the mind of the theorist, to make it
   accessible to the layman. I want someone to be able to look at an image and grasp the concept
   of, say, the Ready-made, or of the tableau-tableau in Cubism, or the concept of Imitation, of
   Reflection, all simple concepts that make up art history. The final project will be a textbook of the
   forms of art and art history, something that has been in my mind for near to 5 years. I'm so
   excited about it, forgive me if it's all I can talk about. My studio is bustling with creation, with new
   ideas, with historical materialism with a spiritual twist.

Regulation offers a systematic punitive strikes on the learner.  We have a graphic system, a semi-language, at the very least a lexicon of terms, subjects, that enter the textbook of art history and rewrite the concepts of art history using the lexicon to categorize by non-category; a thousand plateaus [Deleuze] in conjunction to the rise of an unearthly Logic of art history, art history, an introspection projected on the mind of the for-real, an abstract economics display Exhibition in [semiotics/linguistics/musico-] Tonal Cinema.  The empty theatre Houses the myriad shapes.  Tone is the culprit of this affair.  It was a side-show with binoculars into the phantasmarogian slipknot tied in the blink of an eye under the Belt of Toulouse making posters for Gargantuan Cinematics.

[this is the Allegorical part, called Dante’s Dream on Charon’s Ferry of Noah’s Raven Never Returning… it’s a picture that Victor Vortex holds in his hand… we already have his recollection of his dream, now we have actual dialogue, words of Victor staring at the WATER actually, and thinking of Noah’s Raven into the water, thinking of Water itself, of birds because doves/pigeons are flying around him, he thinks, well why did the dove come back and not the raven, where did the raven go?  The raven goes on and on and plays an abstract, vorticist cinema.  Then we cut in the Cinema, the Volcano, a cathedral with a ceiling [BEAUTY: THE FAULT [crack in the glass] IN VICTOR’S EYE, a crevasse opens up, this is the DREAM not the REVERIE/TRANCE, and Victor [Don Juan] enters the Inferno, another day another Dante] which is the Victor’s eye, the eye that writes historical reality, and then the Empty Theatre that was Vertiginous that Victor stared at from above from the ceiling, well, it becomes nighttime, raven black, and Victor stares at the dome of the sky with flickering lights, feels nauseous… ALL I NEED IS A RESOLUTION TO END IT.

Retelling of Textbook art:
	1)if we were compelled to rewrite history, what format would we utilize?
	2)Perdition is loosely bound to sleep once we covet the surrealist handbook.
	3)we need a Populace to watch the watchers.
	Thus we have an enigmatic beginning to a retelling of previous sectioning.  Why the retelling?  Ah, for it was inimical, uncouth; we are rearranging the parts to tell it rightly, just in rightly being so.  Textbook art is not something I can produce at this moment.  I have a tinge of it, but not the full-blown art.
	So I’ll try my best as of yet.
	‘Textbook Art’ was more in premonition than in truth.  Destitution morsels the mortar off my titanic whites, the longer I cure it, the more so it cannot become now becoming nowsome nothing.  Did you expect me to bounty boot the cutter’s chaste exposition, huh?  Not a chance, damn it.
	We will follow the general composure of This Our Dialectic:
	a)Broken;
	b)mid-Broken, near-Fixed;
	c)Healed;
	d)Broken.
	That’s about how it goes inside me head; the rest is details and is outside the actual dialectic, which is made of paper.  Our Dialectic is made of dendrites.
	Somebody stop me, I’m out of line, incautious, fragmented.  1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6.

TEXTBOOK ART

	I
	All the rain that eats you up inside, the fulsome raging seaway, the puzzle, the aftermath in gloom, ink, and the ropes tied taut; whose to know, that I might further seek?  Ah, to seek is the Hero’s digest, his mistress, prosody, the likening of mothers to their milk: and what rivers divide in mourning?
	Phonographs in the genesis singing winking stars awry, I say, the rotundity flaming wire-walls wisdom in shout, the meter’s done and all that’s left is ash; ashes, calm, brooding, the serenity of watching empty faces misplace a surgeon’s shambles.  Me you want, then me you wisdom wait.  Caution.
	It was a style brought up in the dawn of a young mind, erected as a sonic indifference to moving shapes, sounds, uncouth and broiling mad; a song to sing a-self in solitude and loneliness, psalm in breath, heartbeat, breast caving in with want of new words: all that is news to me, ancient and still wandering through tightly knitted prose.  Romanticism first, Historical Falsification afterish; Metamorphose, meism!
	Yes, you see, I would make the lexicon radiate, add some iconic beauty, some flesh to the whiskers I spill out in absurdio ink; this, my mouth, my soul shrieking in thunderous bellows, yielding not only to the mesmerism of flavorless systematization, tawdry as the minstrel’s feast, but to…
	Awash! vex the open sea! I am no name to save Grace’s wonderment.  Feed me fish for feed, no, anything but human meat, for what else is animal but man, and man mean animalistic?  Feed me knowledge, wisdom, an even load of vanity and cowardice, for I am human, aren’t I? and that means the good, the great, the excellent and the unsightly, grossly dilapidated.
	Give me all that from which I urge salvation.  Grant me my ugliest hour, my broken music, my sagging unstomacheable madness; I will fetch Quiet in the hailstorm for I am beauty as in a leaf falling at Dawn with speckled water-motes descending in spirals scant, puddling itself on the mirthen flowerbed with grim squats awkward receiving what is most in highness, giving what softness creeps at in the modern moment.  Leaves, all a-grass, shielded, mothered in milk and snow-angels ageing, matters nothing truly.
	I hate two things, the abyss and the rose; the rose is destroyed: I dwell in the abyss.  A morose air that I transpose here, brings you a smile by giving you a poor wretch of sighs; it is because the Thing is nervous and harmful: it did not have the nebulous life, the vast and morbid life.
	Group missive, suns in quadrant of Apple: Dawn in stewardess’ Blue Oranges.  White-collar grim waddle twiddle or droop in cosmetics chamber housed as part of a growing encyclopedia; me, the Text, the hunger art, the black and prismed monkeywrench of sad graves besteading morning Nausea.  Sleep next to me, I need a Breather, for I am insomnia personified, and breathless much so very very much.
	I’ll generate a sleeping quoeta, sum sufferance, ghast after-pull gleaming white-satin grails on the burgundy silk; all that is solid turns to irreparable Nonsense.  All that is well-groomed, gifted, turns to spoiled milk, sour matinees with puzzles ear-aching bastardist calumny: O, ah, the stomach’s irretrievable!  Sleep next to me so that I might know Knowledge, that your breath might bring me Light of Daybreak, the Day I’ve not seen for many a season, and dreaming.  Hold me close, the door’s a-closin.  Meet me.
	That’s because [all the I’s] no other words can fit this purpose.  Projector/Projectionist is not a novella, it’s part of an ideogram.  Thus for, how else shall I commit it to Writing?  Some of it is coded, some of it is more relaxed prose; poetry has a cameo appearance, and the overall shape, form, rhythm, music of the Whole IS the Whole and the Whole that P-or/P-ist IS, IS much more than its consummated Parts: P-or/P-ist [pronounced Projection], is an Integration, a System of Thought, poetico-marvellous, magically intertwining, breezed, allaying malaise, greed-solving mint-crowding, Scented Prosaic Textbook Talk, the Revellers, Our Saboteur Behemoth is growing moustaches from tiny violets in the Earthen bed.

Kafka, Poe, Borges, and Tonal Cinema [traditional story-telling as seen through P-or/P-ist]:
The textbook begins.  Always belated beginnings with this typist.  Why typist?  Because I couldn’t possibly pass this off as my own, could I?  I could be lying.  So onwards with the show!  It takes a while to get into Textbook prose, especially the way I want to do it.  You’ll see a)self-analysis, b)story-parts and dandy thoughts, c)lexical database, pictorial database, DNA database, and d)universal conjunction of said parts.  Dilaterally fluiving [sluice] through neurons in toxic gnosis.

Projector/Projectionist part III, return to Ithaca,
Cecilia’s Cages, a Textbook art:
The event, message, the Dream Assembly
through the cages of the soul, the prison,
then the carnival of the cafeteria,
pinwheels à la Burroughsian Peep Show.
These are the forms of the message.
Intricacies are widely found.
A whole panoply of prosodaical functions.
Then it reverts to a narrative where the Baron
is evidently a character which shields me
as a writer so that I can think of
the next wave of symbols.

THE DOCTOR’S OFFICE:
Smoky room with lots of devices, optical, sound and video recording equipment, books of poetry laying face down like a hand of cards, the game is on for doctor and Baron, to project backward in time, to the future simultaneously to assume a position of an-Time, of the between-Time.

The phonograph alternates from playing Varèse to Bartok.  A few Beethoven records here and there neatly interspersed.  Microscopes, light-reading implements, rulers, protractors.

THE BARON’S OFFICE:
Intangible light in the projectionist’s booth.  Oak tables, books stacked on shelves, clean, practical light, an empty theatre, something is on trial in a courtroom.  A book, then at the end of the exhibition, a Horatio, a Judas, against the Baron, a jester, a trickster, against the Knight.  In the Dream Assembly, the Baron also fights for time, sometimes against him.  Intergalactic wars, spaceships, ultramodern architecture.  Judgement on Polarities in Vapors and Abysms.

The Baron is against Justice, against Evolution.  The laborers are with the sad Empress of the puppets.  Justice is the word fighting with the Baron as he narrows the paths of information, cleans the lines.  Old man Time stands watching.

PROJECTION B:
A train, a set of eyes, a skull, a door,
a table, a picture-frame, curtains,
a stage, stone monuments,
sculptures, a high mass and procession.

THE PHONOGRAPH:
Romantic music by Bartok.  Strong
rhythms and melodic lines.  Tied
together by a tight harmonic structure.
Chromaticisms, blaring the anthem.

Fortune at the black funeral.
Cultures intermixing in
cosmopolitanism, 1999.
2001 is the new release
of the Gadget, 2nd flow.
Organism, tautology,
science of rhythms
in daily Speech.

Snow on the plains.  Wintertide is glooming
a portent in its terminal vacuity.  Tornado’s fury.

It ends in a volcanic eruption.
Tied up in numinous knots.

The Magic Flute.  A barbarian’s heart.  Bearded prison guard.

Perspective:
	b)Journal: [notebook]
I just recently discovered that Gide’s Les Faux-Monnayeurs is a tableau-tableau, painting within the painting, frame within the frame, image within the image… and is Cubist…! I think I’ll put these journal entries in the textbook because they show me learning new things about Cubism, and that experience is priceless.  One can then know how to assail Cubism.  It is a matter of taste.

Important Dates: [coefficients of Russia]
1907
Kodac in June 1888 made cameras for the mass public.  This would be a tragic and silent revolution in world consciousness.  A bizarre anti-climax. [1907 to mid-1920s are important to the first life of cubism; cubism would appear afterwards up to the present in various forms.]
The 1920’s had a cubist film by Russian creator Dziga Vertov in ‘Man with a movie camera’.  This textbook style is to exalt the mechanical structures of Cubism.  We are using the cut-up technique, the splice, the photomontage.
1906 was an important year for the discovery of cave-man art.
“1906 is a key year.  It was then that Alcalde del Rio and Padre Sierra discovered the famous caves of El Castillo, Covalanas and La Haza, as well as other caves in Cantabria, which were then studied by Breuil; in the same year F. Regnault came across ancient Aurignacian figures in the cave of Gargas in the French Pyrenees and Molard discovered magnificent animal paintings in black in the ‘Salon Noir’ of the gigantic cave at Niaux, which shortly afterwards were examined by Breuil and Cartailhac.
[‘The Art of The Stone Age’ by Hans-Georg Bandi]

From the Beginning:
The concept of a cubist textbook is phenomenal.  It adheres to the metaphysical space of cubism which is mechanical.  In the motions of the artists, of events, the public is shook, art-tasters come in crowds to see the human spectacles, gods in humanoid form who hoard out works of finest art by the bundle.  A critical time in 20th Century styles were the years between 1905 to 1908.
Famous sentence: “Treat nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere and the cone.”  The man this quote is attributed to is Paul Cézanne in 1907 in a correspondence with Émile Bernard.  I am going to attempt to make a list of themes from memory from what I once read on the internet: 1. Abstract; 2. Two-dimensionality of the canvases; 3. Multiple views; 4. Mixed perspectives; 5. Geometric forms; 6. Analytical; 7. Rational; 8. Monochromatic; 9. Sobriety; 10. Classical.

Cubism was a style and a perspective, had a mechanical twist much like the Futurists and an inlay of the Renaissance. I would say that the aesthetic of Cubism is that of the Mona Lisa.  Non-Euclidean geometry.  Anything an old radio can give on a Sunday.

In Baroque art, Arcimboldo make visages with vegetables, with meat, with fire, books, a gun.  They had paradoxical images, strange trickery of the eye, vague forms, shadows.  We can see Cubism as a modern-classical movement of pure reason in the Kantian sense [because Kant is important to Cubism, is basically the first cubist].  Cubism resembles the Baroque era, remember that.  Surrealism would also have classical elements in Dali, sculptures of Venus, Aphrodite.  Kurt Schwitters would make a flywheel by gluing diverse materials to cardboard, wood, and paper.

	V
Propositional science is the best phrase to exhibit the truth of Cubism in its medical textbook aesthetic.  Cubist writers were able to write with perfect accuracy, strikingly and exponentially real.  The Logic of Cubism lies in propositional discourse, from the ideological ‘I am a creator’ to ‘art is a lifestyle and precinct to courtliness’.  The matter that makes up Cubism’s epistemology can be decreed in such a fashion: a)the object/perspective, b)aesthetic, c)style, d)theory, e)metaphysic, f)size, g)medium, h)time, i)themes, j)phenomenological dialogue.  The latter is a discourse between the one and his or her environment, the first reading and writing function of human existence, the pure state of being, the first state of being: an involvement with phenomena between man and his universe in the first moments of life to the last breath; all the particles that come into contact with one person, all the laws and forces involved, social, political, ecological, geographic, laws of the court, the trials and tribulations of daily experience, the full range of data that can be deduced, inducted, brandished in paper cups, words spilling out of the page, man and his natural world, environmental space; the spatiality of discourse, phenomenology as the ‘strange space’ of modern physics, the logical strain that seeps in the most basic of enunciations: setting.  The challenge is to capture Cubism when and where it is taking place.  This happens when perspective is prominent, when perspective is part of the problematic.
The second unit [enunciation] in the spatiality of discourse beside setting is expression.  That is how the theatre is constructed.  There are other ways.  One, as in Surrealism, can build an entire unconscious-symbolic wheel of meaning and abstract value with automatic painting.  It is a metaphysical illusion.  It involves the body, the mind, and the medium of space between all beings.
The Body.  Before getting medical, we have Mimes, Mallarmé, Diderot, and the paradox of the actor.  In the late 1800s, mimesis comes into the light, people go see mimes perform, mimes perform in the streets of Paris, influence the young Cubist painters.  The childhood of the average cubist painter was being lived in the two last decades of the 1800s.  Childhood and the mimetic function.  This is another aspect of Cubism that can most readily be seen in Picasso’s simplistic paintings, basic forms, elegant brushstroke, a dance with the brush, a casual causality rendered memorable in semi-life-like projections in the macabre theatre of modern actuality.
Again, before Medicine, we have the Body of the Church.  When things get mixed up between Medicine [science] and Religion [Church], we have a positive fluctuation in metaphysical reality in man.  Body and Mind are separated and the problem begins.  Cubism unites it all in the art it generates.  The aesthetic is medical but the paintings are spiritual masterpieces.  Braque and Picasso’s joint improvisations led to brilliant syncopation of abstraction from real objects, rhythmic gestures, elegance of phrase, mind to body collision on canvas.  By medical, we mean anatomical.  Cubism has an Anatomy, birthed in an anatomical serum, liquid that fluctuates and makes mirages.
Take Gray’s Anatomy for a second.  It is a compendium of the different parts of the human body, the human anatomical system.  This resembles Cubism in its multi-dimensionality: in recreating the body part by part, the anatomist seizes all the different perspectives of the body and melts them into one complex prose [with images] that constructs a basically abstract principle: man in-himself.
Wylie Sypher, in ‘Rococo to Cubism’, says: “The special consciousness in the enlightenment was grounded, as Whitehead also noted, in a system of thought framed by seventeenth-century mathematicians, a system very abstract and presenting, on the one hand, precisely located bodies, and, on the other, mind, which succeeded in constructing a conceptual framework of time and space to enclose these simply located bodies.  Newton was the chief architect of this world-order, and his system inspired a religious attitude called deism, centering on a God who was a mathematical intellect.”

It brings it Geometry.  We could say anatomy and geometry are two of the main influences that created Cubism in the 20th century; Enlightenment anatomy and geometry + the Industrial Revolution = Cubism.  It isn’t always as simple, however, as such an equation.  A movement in art is always a complex construct.  Theatricality is another important fraction of Cubism’s true being.  De Stijl, Bauhaus, Suprematism, and Futurism would be the kith and kin of Cubism.

Vernon Hyde Minor, in ‘Art History’s History’ speaks of Les Demoiselles d’Avignon as the first example of Cubism, and says on its subject, it is ‘a style and conceptual form that confronts order and rationality, logical representation, and the embodiment of Western values so necessary to European painting since the Renaissance.’ [p.167]
Here, Cubism is brought near the concept of the Renaissance, as though it came right out of it, which it did, though it waited as long as it could to immediately pop up, ravenous for museum wall-space.  The Cubists’ first North American explosion was, I believe, at studio 291 in New York.

To recap, Cubism was a new metaphysical reality that hit the world early in the 20th century.  One of the terms of this metaphysics was Fragmentation; by fragmentation of the mind and of the canvas, Cubism’s conditions of existence were made evident.  

###

Conclusion:
As is well known, Picasso and Braque spent many years side by side creating off of each other.  Another little known fact is that they had long conversations about realities of the mind, long discourses together that they never did divulge to the public.
	There’s a hiddenness in the true tenets of Cubism.  Only a select few were part of the culture.  More than a few, of course, but in comparison to the population of the world, Cubism is still today rather unknown to most people.  It’s because to understand Cubism you need to dance with Cubism, embrace it, follow it, be its apprentice.  I have tried to show in this essay the path that I have had up till now with Cubism as my mentor.  
	This is it, I have written the beginning of my textbook of art history.  The next section is called Surrealism, and is much longer, about twice the length.  The third part, called On Art History, is probably thrice the length of this one.  Each one has its particular style for its particular mission.
	Cubism is a complex of representatives.  It is a school of thought, a technique, a philosophy, an iconology.  They made musical masterpieces of guitars and mandolins.  The music just breathes through their work.  They captured a metaphysical reality and maintained a rational criticality at all times.
	Cubism: science of the mental construct…

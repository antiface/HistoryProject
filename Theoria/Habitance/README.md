Philosophy of Habitance
-----------------------
* MIGRANCE
* HABITANCE
* SURVIVANCE

THEORY OF HABITANCE:

1. The Habitant makes passage through implementation to erect the Habit-
edifice.
2. Habitance, as the state of being a Habitant, of having habits, of inhabiting
space via habit, theory, technique, of being inhabited by his own habits,
etc., supplements plasticity with domesticity: the realm of objects becomes
the domain or settlement on which the Habitant endures through
programmatic manipulation or management, prescriptive or legislative, of
his or her Template or synchronic constellations (of habit, theory,
technique) leading to historical sedimentation.
3. Habitance is documentary in scope and attains no further than the general
bounds of the human scale.
4. The House of Habit and Memory, with its congealing force, its
condensation, consolidation, concentration, and contraction, is founded
on the body as knowledge, i.e. carnal knowledge or first knowledge.
5. First Knowledge of Habitance has, then, a physiologic basis, and so it is
possible to forward the contention that historical thought or consciousness
proceeds from an initial physiologic economy and awareness of.
6. Habitants are transitional and constantly work through intervals, working
qua implementation, necessarily requiring logonomy, or meaning-giving,
meaning-instituting, meaning-handing: lit. to deal out meaning.
7. To hand meaning: to manipulate. Man as Habitant is forever
manipulative, always having a hand in something. As transitional,
Habitants will make passage through initial or first knowledge, from so-
called network of instincts (program of movement), through the unbroken
chain in the modality of passions towards second knowledge already
closer to historical thought but still only habit-thought or the so-called
theoretic of habitance, which is anaesthetic and philosophic-critical.
8. First knowledge: technic of habitance. Second knowledge: theoretic of
habitance. Third knowledge: Historical consciousness, self-presentation
of History, a.k.a. Domestic moduloscopy of stratified spatial-temporality.

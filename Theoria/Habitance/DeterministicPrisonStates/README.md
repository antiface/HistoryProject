8. Fear-narratives construct an isolated, paralyzed subpersona.
9. Ego-narratives construct a false identity.
10. A private history is constructed internally like a historical discourse - like historians - and we must look at the lost pieces, the ruptures, cavities, abysses.
11. There can be an epochal guilt treatment for social offences, the misbehaving of polities.
12. Fear is self-damnation or auto-damnation, or the prison of the soul.
13. Prison-states are deterministic.

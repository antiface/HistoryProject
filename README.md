The History-Project
===================
* The History-Project;
* A novelistic phemonenology is like a continuous simulation of a novel-as-a-system;
* *The History-Project* was an interdisciplinary art-research project circa 2001-2004, created and operated, documented and now being published solely by myself;

* History forever remains *unfinished*;
* History is the accumulation in strata of *Everything that Remains*;
* History is the skeleton hidden inside a *Great Sacrophagus* called *Planet Earth*, a.k.a. *The Historiosphere*;

* I had been studying Walter Benjamin's works and decided to *Paint the Concept(s) of History*;
* This led to a series of paintings forming a great *Collection*, possibly the only part of this project that didn't fail;
* The paintings are what started the project, and the paintings are possibly what remains most pertinent today, 22 years after the start of the project;
